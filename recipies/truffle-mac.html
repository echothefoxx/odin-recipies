    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A deliscious truffle mac n cheese that is made quickly in the instant pot</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked pasta, could literally be any pasta – I went old school with elbow  </li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth or stock (no one really knows the difference anyway)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream </li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan </li>
        <li>1 cup grated smoked gouda</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded white cheddar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons truffle oil, optional</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons kosher salt </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the pasta, broth and garlic & onion powders into your Instant Pot</li>
        <li>Lock, turn to sealing position, select high pressure and cook 4 minutes, then quick release the steam (you might want to put a towel over the steam cuz pasta water vapor can be messy)</li>
        <li>Add the cream (start with ¾ and add more if you want it creamier), the cheeses, truffle oil if using and salt to taste</li>
        <li>Stir super well until beautifully mixed – and if you’re adding anything else, this is the time</li>
        <li>That’s all folks – time to eat</li>
    </ol>
